            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This ADHD Assistant was inspired by my personal experience managing ADHD, where I aimed to create an application that helps people facing similar challenges with task management, focus, and organization. The app provides practical tools that support day-to-day productivity, including task management, a focus timer, and a note-taking system.
